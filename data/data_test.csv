2,My sibling is severely depressed and I have no idea how to help her.,"My sister is 4 years younger than me, she is 20, and is severely depressed. She goes to therapy and takes medication but she has been doing that for so long (on top of switching medication multiple times) and nothing helps. She feels very lonely but she knows she has us (her family) to support her. She has to go back to school and I always worry for her even though she says she would never end her life..she still wishes she wasn’t alive. It hurts to know she feels this way and I almost feel guilty that I feel fine and am not depressed like that. This is definitely draining to me and my family and it affects my mother tremendously as she also suffers from depression and anxiety.

I don’t know what else I can do to help if therapy and medicine is not helping. I want my sister to feel happy and better and it crushes my heart to know she is suffering every day. 

Any advice on how I can help her? And how I can help her overcome this and be able to be strong to fight this awful feeling she has? Any words of encouragement and advice is appreciated. Thanks all.",depression_help
3,Anti-depressants forever?,"I have been on anti-depressants most of my adult life. You name, I have been on it. All eventually lose effectiveness or cause weight gain or make me lethargic or have some other negative side effect. This monotonous Ferris wheel wears me down. 

Suicide never crossed my mind. It doesn't matter today. But I am weary. I live in a state that is backwater on many things. Being open to research studies using psychedelics is not in its DNA. Yet, at this point, I would try anything to rid myself of this pall. 

My face to the world has been and continues to be one of a person who is in control. I was reasonably successful as an educated professional in a competitive field. Now retired, my abilities are blunted by time. The stress of ""being content"" and ""together"" continues to make days more difficult. 

Is this all there is?",depression_help

5,I think I was sexually assaulted/r**ped. and it’s putting me into a depression slump again.,"
I really don’t know what to do, I’ve been suffering from depression for the last 7 years. But I’ve been getting better, a combination of anti-depressants and forcing myself to believe that all is well has helped me. But something that happened a few days ago has sent me on a negative spiral. I’m getting bad again, I don’t think anyone has noticed yet, but I’m afraid I want make it out this time. 


So this situation happened a few days ago. I had been out with my friends at a club. I had  a few drinks and was pretty drunk. Drunk enough to be slurring my words and kicked out of the club. But not drunk enough to be incapacitated or forgot what happened. I remember everything that happened. 

So i’m outside the club about to call an uber. And I see a young man walk past. Drunk me is always very chatty so I tell him to come over and talk, he tells me that he’s going home and asks if i’d like to join him. 

Now sober me never in a million years would have done that, but drunk me thought it was a brilliant idea. I definitely knew what going home with this man would entail, and I was completely up to it. I wanted to. 

We go to his house and we start hooking up. Mind you, this guy is stone cold sober. Before we started having sex, he asks me “Full consent right?” and I say “Yes” and at the time I meant it. 

But looking back, I was so drunk and he was so sober, it’s definitely a bit messed up right? But that’s not really the parts that bother me. 

The parts that bother me are….

1. I had asked him to use a condom, and he said okay but he never put one on, and I was too drunk to fight it and I didn’t really think about the consequences of not using one. I’m not on the pill currently and I’m afraid that I might have gotten an STD, I don’t know this guy at all or his past sexual history. 

2. The part that really really bothers me was that he filmed me. He asked me if he could film me and I said no. To which he responded “fair enough”. But then after a couple of minutes I looked back at him and saw that he was filming me, after I specifically requested that he didn’t. I remember afterwards I confronted him in a sort of joking manner like “why did you film me after I said I didn’t want to be” to which he responded “i just wanted to send it to my friend” I definitely should have fought it more and asked him to deleted it but drunk me didn’t really think about the consequences and just accepted what he said. 

After I left, he immediately blocked me from Snapchat, which he had asked for as I was leaving his apartment. 

I just feel so used and violated. I know drunk me is an idiot and foolish for going to this strangers house, trust me i’ve learnt my lesson. But it’s so unclear to me what happened. What do I classify it as?

I don’t feel like I can really talk about it with my friends because they’ve all experienced really bad sexual assault cases and it can be quite triggering for them. I’ve never experienced anything like this so I don’t really know how to navigate my emotions in regards to what happened. 

Am I being over dramatic?",depression_help
6,Terrified to start brintellix 10mg,"Hi guys, I am terrified to start brintellix.

7,lost self identity,"I suffer from depression, it's a given. But one day, my boyfriend traveled across the country to come visit me. I was super happy, happiest I've been in months. Well me and him went to a gas station to get some snacks. I usually always get a monster drink but as I stared at the candy and chip aisle I realized I didn't know what the heck I wanted. I didn't know what I liked. My boyfriend, being supportive, kept picking up things asking if it sounded good and my answer was always no. It's like I completely forgot what I liked to eat. Fast forward to a few weeks, I go to the store again, I have no idea what I want. I also went to the clothing section and can't think of what I would wear or anything. It's like i have lost who I am. It's been a struggle and gives me such anxiety because it causes me not to be able to make decisions. Does anyone have any ideas on what could be wrong with me or how to fix it?",depression_help
8,How do I help a brother with depression?,"I feel like I don't do enough for my brother. I mean, I do the most that people say I can do, like listening, being a shoulder to cry on, and just being there whenever he needs me. But even then I feel distant. I feel like I can be colder about it then other people, even though I'd do anything for that guy. I don't know how to talk to him, and I'm scared to ask him about things I'm sure are triggers for him(work, people, drinking, ect.) I just don't know what to do. I want him to stop drinking, or at least stop overexhausting himself and sleeping weird hours. Is there anything more I can do? God bless y'all",depression_help
9,Do you ever miss your depression even though you’re doing better ?,"i have been medicated for almost two years now.
and now i’m as stable i have ever been and haven’t had any bouts of depression in this time 
it’s hard to process that i’m doing well
i don’t know if i think it’s unfair for me to be doing well
or if i don’t deserve to be in the situation i’m in 
but i’m equally happy and proud of myself

i recently started working in a tech job that i got with no experience or degree— when i started college, i was at one of my most depressed moments and couldn’t finish and thought that this would mean that i would be unsuccessful for the rest of my life but the fact that this happened leaves me dumbfounded about my abilities- i sometimes deal with impostor syndrome because of this but i have constant reassurance from my coworkers that i deserve the job which really makes a difference
i’m doing everything i wish i could’ve done as a kid / teenager and have worked a lot on working on my inner child and buying stuff i never had and going to concerts i’ve always wanted to go to.

but i keep missing being depressed, it’s almost like it gave me something to blame when i wasn’t doing well
now that i’m doing everything i wish i had done when i was suicidal 
i look back at pictures and see the depression in my eyes
and i think the sadness comes from wishing someone would have cared enough to realize
i wish someone would have been there for me at that time 
i’m so proud of myself for being able to stay alive and to get help
but i can’t help but feel.. helpless ? i don’t know what the feeling is
and now i don’t know what to do
my life is going well
i didn’t think i would make it this far let alone still be alive 
so why do i miss that emptyness
i’m not suicidal anymore but i think about how different life would’ve been if i would’ve gone through with it and i can’t help but be sad and cry about my pat self
what i would’ve missed, the relationships i would’ve never made, the success that i’ve built for myself
i haven’t thought about hurting myself and have been clean since i started my medication and i know i shouldn’t and i have no desire to do so.. but there are times that i feel like i miss the feeling; maybe it was the sense of control, maybe it’s like an addiction and so i feel the craving ? 
i don’t know
and it’s just been hard— im not empty, im not depressed.. i’m just feel nostalgic of my depression",depression_help

His mom lived in our home before renting it to us, and she is still (9 months later) getting her stuff out. Still charging full rent BTW. So that was stressful, since my bf and her do not have the best relationship. Mom insists on keeping my bf's abusers ashes since his siblings have a ""a different relationship with him"" BF takes ashes from mom after moms find them among her junk left at our house. Mom threatens to call cops over abusers ashes. BF continues to fight with mom over phone. All this in addition to mom waking us up to grab her shit from the house tells us 10 plus things we are doing wrong in house. Takes fire pokers (she has a pellet stove and doesn't need them) plus one of our dogs attacks my service dog.....I just don't know how to handle this anymore.

12,Im not coping and I’m having thoughts. How can I quickly get my brain out of a physical situation without physically leaving,,depression_help
13,I don’t know what to do.,I moved out when I turned 18 and lived alone for a year until my friend ran away from home and moved in with me. I was already doing pretty bad mentally and at first then being around helped. I bought them new stuff and eventually moved into a bigger apartment with more space for both of us. Long story short neither of us are doing okay mentally and I don’t think I can take it anymore. I want to help them but being around them is hurting me so much. I want to be there for them especially because I’ve been going through a really rough time financially and they’ve helped me a ton. I really feel like I need to leave but I don’t know where I would go and I don’t want to leave them because I’m scared they won’t be ok without me.

16,How to get depressed/anxious family member to get help,"Recently, my father began to feel feelings of anxiety due to health issues. Although the health checkups return negative results, i.e. he is healthy, he continues to feel anxious and it developed into anxiety/depression. He then visited a GP who gave him an antidepressant (AD) 1. He took it for 2\~3 months till he started to feel agitated which led to him cutting off AD1 immediately. He then went to a hospital which gave him another AD2. During the period of consuming AD2, he had terrible side effects (possibly from the drawback from AD1 too) such as unable to urinate and many other symptoms which led to him cutting off any AD entirely. He then stopped eating ADs completely and couldn't decide if he wanted to continue with medicine, after 2 \~ 3 weeks, he decided to pick up AD again as he could not cope with his worsened condition after being off ADs. He got new ADs from a GP again but now he has doubts about hospitals as he had a bad experience before.

He then cancelled all follow-up psychiatrist appointments (ON HIS OWN) from the hospital due to the following reasons:

1. He feels that they do not take him seriously
2. Long waiting hours
3. unable to get to psychiatrist's office alone (family members have work/school)
4. He feels psychologist/counselling will not help him as he feels that his anxiety did not stem from a traumatic event...
5. He is taking medicine from another GP and not the hospital anymore

I am feeling very frustrated right now as he is rejected all sorts of help and he only wants to stay at home and feels depressed and anxious. His anxiety seems to be getting worse over time which makes my family worry for him even more... is he overreliant on the AD? Should he be trying to do more activities? We are not sure how to get him on the road to recovery which is why we are suggesting him to visit a counsellor/psych (along with eating AD) but he is not willing to try as explained from point number 4 above...

I'm looking for help on how to convince my father to see a counsellor/psychologist. Also, what are some other ways for him to recover?",depression_help

18,I want to die,"I miss the dogs I love and my best friend/ex girlfriend/ love of my life and I don't know how to stop feeling horrible. I can't keep feeling like this every day. I wish I didn't mess everything up I get little glimpses of happiness, but my happiness has gone away mostly and it feels like it's my fault. I have to distract myself constantly but it doesnt work and my meds dont work for this but for all the other depressive symptoms they work i think idk I miss being happy and idk how long I want to continue to try but I feel so alone all the time now bc a lot of interactions with people just remind me about how I can't connect with anyone the way I did with her. I have so much love for her and it feels like I might be in love with someone ill never see again or ever talk to again. I dont know what to do or why im writing this but the person i feel most comfortable being vulnerable with is gone and I feel like maybe she doesnt give a shit about me anymore but I would give anything to just spend time with her and take care of her. I never feel at home anywhere I go now because I always felt at home when I was with her. My head hurts and i cant sleep and i think im starting to dislike eating. I kinda hate myself now because of this and have even picked up smoking cigs because I cant get really high and pass out like I had been doing to cope or to even just enjoy life.

19,pls help i dont know how to explain these things that are happening to me,"hello. i'm (18F) having trouble with myself recently. i don't know what it is and i don't know how to explain it to the point that i want to talk to a therapist. i feel so empty atm nowadays. i have a bf (20M) who's been supportive and committed. we love each other so much and we're planning to get married in 3 years so we could move to another country and have a better life.

i was a happy kid last 3 years ago, i usually talk to my friends that much and i know my priorities. i was not feeling sad and anxious and everything. but i realized that i see myself changing to a person that is not the same anymore. now, i feel lost. i cry every night. i've lost motivation to do the things i want to do. i stress out myself too much especially in uni. it was weird because last week, it was the first time that i've cried over an academic related problem. yes i've cried inside the women's restroom, though i was so carefree back then. everything is so stressful now. i've started being distant with my friends and think so negatively about them. i think that they don't care about me and don't want me as a friend. i also have depressive episodes every night. i have crippling depression and separation anxiety where i don't want someone (close friend, s/o, or somebody who i think is special) to leave me.

now i know you have been wondering what does this have to do with my boyfriend of almost 3 years now. our relationship has been like a rollercoaster. it was going on like a pattern. at the very start, i was the one who did the first move and he liked me also. when he was trying to court me the first time we met, i was hesitant for the first few months and was scared to fall in love as it was my first time engaging in a serious 'relationship'. but eventually, after a few months, i've finally agreed to date. but there were kind of flaws that we have done in the past that led to us having an on and off relationship. i've tried to act very sweet so he could think that i'd feel the same way even though it was uncomfortable to me. basically he wanted me to answer him like he was trying to rush me so he could finally stop overthinking yet at that time, i was in a 50/50 situation because i was scared to commit.

starting from that, we continued talking and talking until we had fights. he was being really clingy and told me to stop doing this and that and i was mad because why would he tell me that when we were not in a relationship, we haven't had a label yet. i wasn't his priority at that time that's why i focus on myself and my friends, actually leaving him behind. afterwards, he began to break the connection and i agreed because he was too clingy and wanted a lot of attention. (that was also the time that he was having in his lowest point of life; depressed) he didn't want anyone to leave him. we have began the on and off thing where we do a comeback then break up then vice-versa. i know, so toxic right? but last year, i was the one who broke up with him because he wasn't being communicative. whenever he gets mad, he starts being sarcastic and giving me the silent treatment. whenever i tell my side, he replies with just a few words and all. he said he was sorry for being clingy. we broke up in good terms but had another issue with him in a week. i began feeling attached to him until i stalked him flirting with another girl for a rebound. they did some nasty talking and this girl was trying to seduce him and stuff and he was like ""why not, my ex is not coming back to me anymore"", after a month of stalking them on my social media, i've assumed that they are both trying to make their exes jealous because the girl also has an ex but the problem is that she fell in love with him. he stopped and finally replied to my text i sent him the day before we got together again and we luckily fixed our relationship. the whole month of not being with him has fucked my head so hard after knowing what happened to the point that i got traumatized with what he did. (we got back together in november)

we hadn't had any arguments about us eversince the comeback and i thought everything is going healthy for us until this july, he was at my place sleeping and i was doing something on his phone and i thought to myself that what would happen if i searched the conversation with his friend who linked him to the girl back when we broke up and i didn't expect what i saw. i realized that whatever he explained when we got back together was a full ass lie and the fact that he denied everything i told him about my assumptions was sickening. everything that i've assumed from my gut was all right. starting from that day, my trauma was slowly growing and got worse day by day. i felt insecure, i felt worthless, i gave him everything that i didn't do back then, i was the one who got clingy and desperate, i started becoming anxious, everything negative was growing in me just because of that girl? now, we were the opposite, i was the one who's clingy and he's the one who's not and focuses on his priorities too. it's like his mental health became okay while mine was rotting in hell.

these days, i am being aware that i am the toxic one. i am not understanding. i want him to listen to me and do the things i want him to do. i am selfish. i am greedy. i am so attached to the point that if he leaves me i'd lose my mind. i'm falling apart right now, also adding up my personal problems. recently i got mad for the smallest reason and he was saying sorry, being sincere yet i didn't accept his apology and got more mad. then he got mad also and that's where he started to break up with me as a threat and i backed up and started losing myself because he said we're breaking up and he doesn't want to talk to me. (it traumatized me and i began having anxiety attacks starting from that night) he did this to me for the second time now, last week was his last. after that, we started becoming communicative and promised to never do it again. he was understanding while i was not. i am severely falling apart and he's helping me to go through my darkest days.

can someone please explain to me what does this mean. why am i like this? giving me an advice about how to get through this would mean a lot to me. thank you.",depression_help

24,I don't like depending on medication,"I (26f) have been constantly medicated for three years. I never liked antidepressants/anticonvulsants due to the side effects, but I felt it was needed during a period where I was coming to terms with childhood trauma and basically just getting my shit together. Now I'm happily married, in therapy and starting CBT, and have a career with benefits that I enjoy. I spoke to my doctor and am slowly tapering off Effexor for about four months, and I absolutely hate it. 

I feel as though I have no energy and can't get out of bed. I'm struggling to take care of myself and feel gross, but it's like a weight is holding me to my bed and the hours slip by without me realizing. I hate that I can't care for myself and it's beginning to show in my house and job. I'm in the best place I've ever been in my life, but it feels as though the effects of my mental illness are stronger than ever. 

I hate being on medication because I often feel numb and dependant, but I'm concerned I'll have to be on them for the rest of my life and have to choose between numbness and some energy most days, or being a depressed blob instead of a functioning member of society. I feel like it's a damned if I do/damned if I don't scenario and could really use some advice before my next appointment at the end of the month.

I am having a good life at the moment, everything is going right but I just couldnt' find my root cause why I'm feeling these way.

This put me further into my depression, I literally cried all night over it. The reason? Well the night before I had a terrible dream that put me into my depression. Anywho, the same mod was making fun of me tonight in the live that I almost didn’t even join to begin with.

Idek anymore... I found out my best friend of 9+ years was just having me around for the sake of it... They didnt really care about me... My grades have been dropping and the situation at home has worsened because of it... I feel like I dont have a bright future and I may not get my dream job because of my marks. My recent most test, for which I prepared a month ahead for let me down. Ive barely passed in 3 of the 5 subjects. I was an 85% student and I dropped to this. My ""bff"" was my only friend at school... I dont have anyone anymore... I dont know myself... Ive let go... Ive let anorexia get to me... I went from being healthy and the correct weight to severely underweight in a snap. I barely get sleep. Im constantly fatigued and all this stress made me pass out in classes. I was then taken to a doctor and diagnosed with anemia... Both my parents think of me as a failure. Even I think of myself as a failure now. I have thoughts of ending it... I start crying out of the blue... My anxiety wont let me do anything... I feel I may be autistic with all the comments hurled at me every single day and the multiple different tests Ive taken because of it. Im called childish and everyone avoids me. Ive been constantly bullied and avoided since 1st grade. It hurts when all your classmates, so called ""friends"" all go out to malls, restaurants and hang out, post on social media and the entire class is there except you. It feels day by day, I become more, idk, dead inside. There's this constant numbness in me. Im constantly called ugly and ""a rat"" by most people at school. I have chronic sinusitis and Ive never been ""not sick"". Im sick all the time. Im sick of all of this. I no longer have interest in doing anything. I dont want to talk to anybody anymore. I dont want to wake up and live this life anymore. I wish this would all end. I dont know what I should do... I wont be allowed to visit a therapist. Do i have depression? Will this drive me to do something I may regret? Im scared... I didnt ask for any of this... Please help me. It hurts to keep living this. Not knowing who I am and why I am... I feel I have nothing left for me... If there was anything to begin with. I have ADHD which doesnt help either... My guitar and dog help me somehow... Even my guitar, my one beam of love, is feeling tiring... I dont have interest in sports, video games or anything anymore... I guess this is the best place to ask, could I be depressed? Is this it? I cant get treated by a therapist as there are two in my area and theyre expensive... My parents will brush me off, say its nothing and probably take away my computer... A week ago, I let go of all social media when I realized I felt the worst since ever... I felt my worst. It hasnt helped though... I still feel horrible... I have nobody to go to for comfort except you guys... Please idk anymore... All I can feel is pain...

I had a terrible week. I’ve been so stressed because I just started this job last week but it’s my first full time, 5 days a week job and it was overwhelming. It’s the type of job where they just threw me into the fire and I couldn’t take it. I had a panic attack at work this past Monday then got home and had a nervous breakdown. I missed four days of work after Monday and three days my first week because I got sick. 
Maybe it wasn’t the job for me, but now I’m unemployed and I feel so hopeless. Idk if I should reach out to my previous job that I left for this one. I enjoyed my previous job but I was underpaid and broke constantly. I don’t know if they would even take me back because they probably hired new people already. 

My first thought after hearing I was fired was “I’m useless. I want to die.”
I’m still not sure if I want to live or die. 
This happens every fucking time I start a new job. I get overwhelmed and depressed; then when I get out of the depression, I’m faced with the mess I made while I was depressed.

I am a very jealous person, and this year we went to different schools, I'm ok with her making friends and all, but a lot of boys and girls always try to hit on her, even tho I believe she won't go for anyone, I had never accepted the fact that one day it could just happen. I'm too afraid to lose her, we've been through so much together, that just thinking that I can't be with her everyday like we used to has been killing me for a long time now, I've became such a better person because of her, trying to be someone she will enjoy to be with, but seeing that my feelings may not be corresponded is making me weaker and weaker every day, all that and the fact that I live in a broken home, all this things are taking a toll on me, every day I feel the agony of having to push through to get to a better place, but without any friends but her, or any sane family around me, some ver bad thoughts invade my head more and more.

I thought falling asleep was the best thing I’ve ever heard of. Plus this elder made it seem so easy. So that’s what I’ve been up to.

Sometimes I’ll buy a $50 bottle of Hennessy and drink half of it right before bed. Other times I’ll just go to bed very early. One night I even took 18 sleeping pills and chugged liquor right before bed. But nothing has worked, not even marijuana.

I’m sure I’m making progress because death is the last thing. Plus in dreaming heavily. I remember one dream where I was in such a deep sleep that I kept asking myself “Am I dead?”

I have a plethora of reasons why I want to fall asleep. I may be homeless soon, my benefits might get cut off, I’m tired of life, family abuse, no future, etc.

46,Depression is so consuming,"Not sure of this is the best sub to post this in.

I've spent more than half my life riding the ebbs and flows, rising up and breathing then sinking deep under depression. When it's at its worst, I feel so unlovable and worthless, that life is so pointless and heartbreaking, and I find myself struggling so hard to carry on. 

I've always been good at taking care of my responsibilities and just making sure I get it done because I feel like I have no other choice and also will lose the value people see in me if I don't follow through with work, friends, life things.

The worst for me is I was always social but I'm always finding myself so convinced that people don't really like me or don't enjoy my company as much as they say they do. I often feel like I'm the friend in any friend group that people wouldn't care if I wasn't around. When people reach out, while I initially am very happy I find myself ultimately deciding that it can't be genuine, that there's usually some ulterior motive.

It's a hard, lonely life isolating myself from others to protect myself. I think it mostly stems from  too much betrayal and abandonment as a kid and teen from my friends not being genuine with me. But it's something I've been unable to work through and unable to find a new therapist because insurance makes it so complicated.

This is mostly just me ranting because things have been really hard. I have kids now and often feel guilty bringing then into such a cruel world. I worry they'll suffer from depression like I Do. I also have a very unfulfillijg relationship that I won't elaborate on but I'm not sure how much longer I can really stay in.

I'm not objecting to any advice that anyone has if you've been able to work through similar feelings. Not sure what I'm really looking for here.

I’ve been impatient about three times and been to counseling / day programs about a dozen times already too. But nothing is helping. I’ve come to terms that I am someone that just can’t be helped. 

Then there’s my mom. The one person in my life who’s been trying to be actively “supportive” throughout all of this. I say supportive loosely because it’s only true some of the time.

A little backstory, my mom is a Vietnamese immigrant who doesn’t know much of mental health / just believes people can “get over it.” But throughout these 5 years she’s slowly changed to become a more supportive figure. But one thing still stays the same. 
The guilt-tripping.

Any time I bring up that I’m struggling or hurting inside, she says she’ll die if I get hospitalized again. Every. Damn. Time. She begs me not to tell anyone any of my struggles. And I know she needs help too, but I honestly don’t think she’ll ever want to get any help either. 

I love my mom with all my heart. And that’s why it hurts even more that what I’m going through is hurting her. 

I’m stuck. And my mom has been trying so hard to pull me out of this dark hole I’ve dug myself in. But now I’ve realized that I was dragging her down with me.

No one know I self harm, I’m pretty good at hiding it, that I doubt anyone would even think I’m suicidal sometimes. Every time I self harm I feel disgusted with my self for doing it to my body and want to stop but at the same time I see no reason since it’s not effecting anyone but me and no one else knows I do it. I just need help or some way I can convince my self I need to stop. I can’t go to anyone about it though because I just feel to disgusting and ashamed about it and I hate the stigma around self harm that people do it for attention and I don’t want people thinking I’m doing it for that reason.

I found out that my wavier for the army got denied and I was really hoping to get into the military because I just wanted to get away from home (it’s toxic).

54,I need advice please help me,"(English is not my first language so I'm sorry if some parts sound weird)

Ok so I'm 19M and I've been doing therapy treating depression, (social)anxiety and BDD for 3 years. I briefly took meds for a couple of months in 2020 but I didn't like it at all, I felt like it was doing harm to my body, I had this very weird feeling of not feeling like myself (this is kind of a generic way to put it but it was worse than it sounds), also I had strong sexual and romantic side effects. So after a couple of months I told this to my therapist and psychiatrist and asked if I could start to get off of them and they agreed. Almost immediately after stopping I felt better in almost every sense, I wasn't as depressed as I was before and I also felt more social and felt like I was improving overall, a couple of weeks went by and sadly I had to stop therapy with this therapist that had helped me a lot in the past year because she was pregnant, it got me by surprised and I felt really bad because I felt like only her could help me, so I stopped therapy for two weeks and then I started with a new one which was TERRIBLE, I hated her, I'm not gonna get into details but she wasn't as good of a professional as the previous one, but I had to endure that for a year because I didn't have another choice, I don't pay for therapy it's part of the healthcare provided to the families of first responders so I have to settle to what's given to me.

 So back to the present I managed to get back with the previous one and I'm on therapy with her again now for 5 months, and since then she's been asking me to take meds again, I've been very clear that I really don't want to and she let it slide for the first few months but now she's telling me that if I don't go to a psychiatrist and start taking it she will have to stop treating me, that was kind of shocking to me, we're never able to get a full conversation about this because it always comes up in the end of the sessions, she didn't give me an ultimatum or anything like that but she sounds serious about it, I accepted going to a psychiatrist but I still don't want to take them and I don't think I will. I don't know what to do, I feel like I can do this without meds but that's all my therapist is worried about right now, it's almost as if she's waiting for me to take meds to start the actual therapy.. So I guess my question is: is there a way to get better without the meds? :/ This situation makes me feel like that's the only way even though I feel like I can do it without. I'm kind of desperate because I have no idea what to do, I need her to believe that I can do this but she seems pretty confident that this is what I need.

56,"Months-long Existential Crisis, Suidical Ideation, Depression episode","Hi all, just looking for some advice:

Back in April I started randomly having panic attacks which has never happened before in my life. I’m 22. Ever since, it has evolved into a lot of things that myself or medications haven’t been able to fix yet.

It turned into what I believe is depression and also nonstop intrusive thoughts. I also get feel like I’m in a dream a lot, which from what I’ve read could be something called dissociation as that describes the dream-like feeling I have.

I’ve been to my doctor over the last few months and have tried Lexapro, Effexor 75/150MG, and am now on a combo of Wellbutrin/Effexor. I’d say things have gotten better on this combo as I’ve been on it for a few weeks now, but definitely not 100% and I just don’t feel normal.

The main constant, and I’d say the worst issue, is I’m dealing with a lot of thoughts regarding suicide and it's pretty much nonstop every day. It's just very unlike me and disturbing and I'm unsure how to get relief yet from the thoughts. I'm also having a lot of existential thoughts, such as why am I here and why are we here as a whole. I think these thoughts are linked to the suicidal thoughts, and I'm just unsure of what's going on with me. It still feels like this was a 180 suddenly when all this started, as before I never had thoughts like these or thought about all this existential stuff.

I'm just so scared and different and don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing all the right things but can't get myself back to normal. I want these thoughts to stop so bad, but I cannot shake them no matter what",depression_help
57,How do you find a balance?,"How do you find a balance?

Life for me goes like this: Wake up when my boyfriend wakes up to get my daughter ready for daycare while also feeding our three month old baby(Boyfriend feeds too and we usually pop a blanket out if our hands are too full). Change some diapers, send diapers wipes and clothes nearly every day of the week because we’re pretty sure they’re using our stuff on other babies. Maybe argue with my boyfriend a little because I’m cranky because we both slept all of six hours the night before. He leaves, I still have my son, I’m at home with a crippled knee. All day it’s up and down with bottles and diapers. Luckily I have a friend staying with me that is an amazing help, so my boyfriend has it much harder than me. But stimulation wise, I am clocked out by the time he gets home so when he does it’s just like a dead vibe. 


His days go like this: Wake up, do any baby responsibilities I’m not doing, make himself something quick to eat unless he’s going to McDonald’s, get dressed, go work for 10h a day. Then get my daughter from daycare, come home, and either relax and eat and care for the babies with me or take a shower, watch the babies, and not relax at all. 

I would say we’re ok at splitting baby things even though he’s been doing a phenomenal job lately with picking up after my bad knee 

But it’s all babies. Not once in the last year has this man bought me a flower, or taken me on a nice date that he planned himself much less at all, neither of us brush our teeth often if at all, he hasn’t had a haircut in months, my hair is always knotted and on the verge of matting, we are always broke, and the house is always gross with toys and bullshit on the floor because neither of us pick up all he way. 

Our parenting is disgusting to say the least. 


Before you bash either of us I am actively working with a parent coach and also trying to guide him because he’s a first time dad to our son. I have been firm with him but patient. And I admit that I correct his mistakes myself instead of just making sure he does it right the next time. 

Ways I need to fix my parenting: I need to be more patient with my daughter, I need more quality time with my son and daughter both alone and together. I need to start making sure my daughter eats healthier even though she refuses anything nutritious now. So I feel like I’m failing too.

My boyfriend: he can stop giving our two month old baby 8oz premade formula bottles with the bottle nipple jammed on it because he doesn’t feel like pouring a bottle and then having our baby throw up an entire cup of formula in under ten minutes. Or change diapers more often, or bathe his son. He nearly refuses to bathe our son because he’s “delicate”. And he is extremely annoyed by the toddler because she’s in a very energetic, stubborn phase. So am I. 

I’m not going to hide these things anymore. If I am a bad mom then I at least want to work to be a better one. 

I want you guys to look at the next thing I’m going to post on my profile, there are also a lot of posts where you can see some backstory and I know I’m going to get BLASTED in the comments. But you’ll see what I used to look like before I met him and what I look like now after kids and fighting and going through a whole CPS case and multiply, multiple depressive episodes.

I am insecure, impatient, and I’ve treated my family as if they are a burden to me. I regret turning into the young woman I am today. I am still a baby and not ready for all this. So many grown up things in one box. If I could move back in with mommy and daddy I would but they put me in foster care at 15 and they are now divorced because of the stress I put on the both of them.

I see myself turning into my mother. How she acted toward my dad, and how she acted toward me, and I’d like to be anything but. I want to be that wife that her husband just can’t take his eyes off of. I get comments like “well I’ve been cleaning and I made food so you should be grateful” but those are just basic things we should be doing in the first place. Why don’t you surprise me with some ugly balloons and just sit me down with a glass of wine while you massage my neck? And I can find more creative ways to endear you as well. It all sounds so simple but it’s really not. We are both severely broken people and I don’t know how to turn it around. I’ve gained nearly 40 pounds, he’s gained some weight too. And it’s like we hate each other. Not even two years in. 

I feel like I scored the fucked up life. 8 want to end it because I feel like I’ve failed at everything but I saw a post yesterday about a girl who found her boyfriend hanging in their garage and it broke my heart. Why does it have to be so hard? Why can’t I just opt to off myself without any consequences or feelings? If I could I would. I say I want to kill myself so often now that he barely had a reaction to it, it’s just like a normal part of our conversations. 

In every aspect of my life there is SOMETHING WRONG and I have completely lost myself to motherhood. I don’t have any hobbies no more, no personality. Neither does he. We don’t go on walks, eat vegetables, drink water. We are just sad young parents who are scraping by and regretting everything. 

I pray we fix ourselves one day before it’s too late, but it is extremely hard work. I understand that I’m accountable for all of my failures. 

When will I be that girl again?

Everywhere on Facebook people are getting married, buying houses, having children. And I'm just here in my bed with my cat, eating popcorn watching Family Guy for the 1000th time lmao.

Life hasn't been easy and I do suffer from depression. Had a breakdown in 2018 but I like to think I got over it and cured myself but it just haven't gone away. Everyone's got hobbies or things they like to do.. tbh I just enjoy doing sweet fuck all.

There are things I'd like to do. Lose weight, get better my job and maybe build up some savings but that's nothing big or exciting. Just feel so lost atm and I don't know what to do to make life better. Tried getting a boyfriend but I literally can't keep it going. 

Has anyone who felt like this once got any advice on how to re-motivate and to just feel happy for once? I'm sorry if I sound like a selfish bitch I know there's loads of people in worse situations but just wanted somewhere safe to talk about it I don't talk to anyone else about things like this I don't see the point they just don't know what it's like.",depression_help

61,Lost and disconnected,"I’m 24F , almost 25. I have been dealing with a great amount of sadness over the past 2 years. Its been impacting my mental state as well as physical. I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years and prior to that I had been mentally and physically abused by my parents my whole life. My dad is narcissistic and my mother was just trying to please him until she realized it was wrong to hurt me to avoid being hurt herself. I have a sister who regardless of our abusive family history has managed to thrive and succeed in her studies to pursue a career. I , on the other hand have been struggling mentally and gradually over the past 10 years. I was severely neglected and mistreated by mostly my father and faced the fact he favorited my sister over me , which greatly impacted myself worth. I always tried to do things to impress him but it was never enough. When I entered my abusive relationship, my ex had the same characteristics as my father , and gradually became abusive and aggressive just like him. I tried to leave the relationship multiple times but he was very manipulative and encouraging to have me stay. I regret it so much. After I finally managed to set myself free , I’ve been feeling really unstable. Its been 4 years since we’ve parted ways , I am in a new relationship now with my partner 21M who is different and passionate about being with me. Its been very difficult considering I have come from a long line and history of abuse throughout my life , finding someone who is showing me and giving me the love and support I have always longed for. Difficult in the sense where because of my trauma , I have Depression , Anxiety , and PTSD which led to me being diagnosed with BPD ( Borderline Personality Disorder). I am not on meds and have never been on meds for my symptoms before the diagnosis because I have always feared it would not work for me or would make me feel worse. I’m terrified and scared because I have been getting worse. I lash out in anger , I cry about it after the damage has been done. I feel so disconnected with my family and people in general. I have not been able to hold on jobs as of recently because my mind constantly runs and runs and doesn’t let me sleep. I barely eat , I barely go out and when I do , I need to constantly drive everywhere instead of taking walks. I have been trying hard to fight this on my own without meds for years now and I am losing my battle against this hard , but because I’ve grown tired of having of being tired. Tired of not having energy and motivation to do anything. This past year I’ve done nothing but create a hollow hole in my bed and now as of recently my couch. I have lost myself in this darkness and every time I think I get out of it. I fall back down because I turn on the motor and trigger myself into the same thoughts over and over again. I need help and I have been trying to seek help but I have not heard back from any Psychiatric places. I struggle to even sometimes reply back and text anyone who messages me , but I am tired and feel defeated with everything that has happened in my life. 

I love my partner so much and I just want to be happy. I feel because of everything I am not healed from yet is affecting not just me but my relationship with him. I slowly see him lose his light and get dragged into the darkness along with me. I don’t want this to happen and I don’t know how to prevent it. My daily routine and actions isn’t healthy and it isn’t helping. Financially I’ve done so much but I can’t always buy my way out of every situation. I want to wake up and feel happy. Instead I wake up and dread the time I wake up and how its so nice outside and I want to do something but I feel this weight on my chest and head bringing me down and preventing me from doing so. 

If you have any advice as to how I can try to better my life , or how I can slowly start to have a will to live. I would be more than grateful to hear out. Thank you for reading my little post.

65,Do not choose sadness," I sometimes reach a point where sadness becomes my comfort zone. I am familiar with it, I don't feel particularly threatened while in it, and sometimes it seems a more attractive alternative to the daily grind and struggles. Don't do this, though. Don't choose sadness as the state of mind you want to be in. Don't make a descent into sadness a viable alternative to living your life. If you are tired, rest.

Last year July my mom passed away. Ever since then I’ve always been in bed on my phone. On TikTok for 8-9 hours straight. I started working so now it’s like 2-3 hours. Im definitely sad every day of my life and have 0 motivation to do anything. I used to like washing dishes, taking showers , being organized and doing laundry etc. but now I literally do not like to do anything at all. I feel like every aspect of my like has become a task I need to complete. This is just a small part of what I feel. I have no interest in anything in life. No interest in eating ( which was my favorite thing to do) and just so much more. Yes im in therapy. I feel a hole in my heart and I get panic attack sometimes. I used to get it frequently 2-3 months after she passed. Now it’s reduced. I listen to songs that make me cry more. I was an extrovert but I think I’m an ambivert maybe or introvert. I cannot/ do not have energy to talk to anyone. 

I don’t think I have depression because I don’t have any suicidal thoughts or tendencies. But I don’t know what’s  this phase of life. Any advice?",depression_help
72,Looking for Some Clerification,"So, years and years ago I was going though a big emotional thing and was regularly seeing a guidance counselor as a sort of pseudo-therapist. She helped me realize that sometimes things, or signs of things, like self-harm and mental illness can be subtle. For example—

I had never thought of myself as the type to harm myself or take my own life. I always believed that every breath of life was precious even if I was suffering tremendously. This ideology came from a very early fascination, and subsequently, an overwhelming fear of what happens after death. After an emotional birthday party that resulted in an uneaten cake and a broken bedroom door, I locked myself away without food for a little over two days. I did not leave my bed. No one checked on me. 

My intention was never to hurt myself. I’m notorious for starving myself temporarily when I’m upset enough. I figured I was being dramatic. But months later when I relayed the story to my guidance counselor, she made me realize that even though it was unintentional or subconscious, I was indeed trying to hurt myself, just not in the way self-harm is usually portrayed. 

So now, I’m wondering, can you unintentionally plan your own death as well? I’ve tried researching subtle signs of suicide, but every article and Reddit post I can find so far gives me the same traditional signs we all know to look out for already. I want to know if suicide has another less-obvious form, like a joke you tell yourself a little too often, or a voice that tells you that you should do it, but with a planned cop-out, because maybe it would speed up the process of finally getting the help you don’t have the strength to keep fighting for. Almost like your mind is trying to find an excuse to perform the act.

So basically what I’m asking is, 
can suicide be subtle to the person being drawn to it?

———

I’m really sorry I went into story time. I have a lot on my mind. I hope my question doesn’t seem dumb. It’s just something I’ve been wondering for awhile and I can’t seem to find an answer. Any replies would be fantastic. Good day to you all. :)",depression_help
73,How can I help my ex-girlfriend?,"So last Sunday, me and my ex mutually decided to break up. However, she's had CoViD for the last week and has had to isolate. While she's been isolating she's felt too unwell both physically and mentally to do anything besides lie in bed doing nothing (not even watching anything) or sleeping. We're currently studying at uni and if she didn't have to isolate then she'd at least have her course and her societies and her friend groups to distract herself from her sadness over the break up, but because of her situation it's all she's been thinking about.

Every day since Sunday, she's called me just to tell me how horrible she feels both physically and mentally, how much she wants the pain to just be over, how upset she is that we had to break up, how she wishes that she'd waited for us to break up until after she'd recovered from CoViD, and even how she doesn't wanna be alive and is having suicidal thoughts, and is also resisting the urge to self-harm, which she hasn't done since the early days of our relationship.

One of the reasons we weren't compatible as a couple is because I never knew how to help her when she was having an anxiety attack. And when I'd see her distressed without knowing how to help her, or when I'd try to help her and not get anywhere, I'd get stressed out myself. And then she'd end up feeling even worse. So when she's rang me recently just to tell me everything I wrote about in the first paragraph, it's just been really heartbreaking and I've listened mostly in silence because I've had no idea what to say and I wanna try to stay level-headed for her, but that's only made me seem cold. Recently we figured out that she doesn't want me to try to make her feel better, she just wants me to understand and validate her feelings. But I don't really know how to do that besides just telling her that I understand, but there's only so far that goes and it started to sound repetitive to her after a while. I've asked her what the best way to respond is when she's having an anxiety attack, and she told me that 'she doesn't know what she wants'. And if even she doesn't know then how can I? So I'm hoping maybe Reddit can give me answers?

Even though we're broken up, we're still each other's best friend, which is both why we're still contacting each other so soon after breaking up, and why I'm still trying to help her. I just want her to be okay but I have no idea how to help her. I'm the only person she feels she can talk to when she's like this. We only just started uni so she hasn't had her friend groups here long enough to feel like she can lean on any of them. So if I can't be there for her or help her, then she has no one to turn to and I can't do that to her.",depression_help

75,Dealing with Life,"I am not sure if I am using the right flair for this but here it goes. I am 23, living in India. I was diagnosed with Spinal Tuberculosis in March 2022 and it was affecting my motor skills. My fingers were numb and I was unable to use both my hands. I had unbearable pain in my upper back. The doctor diagnosed that the Tuberculosis is in my cervical spine which is around the neck region and with the condition I was in I would require an urgent surgery. I had my 4th Semester major exams in March and could not undergo surgery at that time as I didn't want to leave my exams in between. I was unable to pick up anything with my fingers but I somehow managed to give my exams on time as I had the option of typing my exam on the laptop. I scored 85% in my exams. 

Afterwards I underwent surgery and it went smoothly. The only problem was that I had to wear a neck brace for 2 months to keep my neck in one position. Moreover since the surgery was performed from my throat, there was damage to my vocal cords and I partially lost my voice. The 2 months of recovery were very depressing for me. I only had my family, my girlfriend and few friends for support in that time. Only my family was around me at home helping me out with stuff. Being unable to speak loudly and sometimes being unable to speak at all, I kept a stick near me to create noise anytime I needed something. 

My only motivation to get better was to be able to meet my girlfriend without any my neck brace and hoarse voice. I wanted to be in perfect condition to meet her. I did all my finger excercises and respiratory excercises to recover pieces of my body. My girlfriend was in another city due to her studies and she had promised me that she will come back on my birthday to meet me.

Eventually my birthday came and it was very sad. I was still wearing my neck brace and I was unable to speak to anyone who called me. My girlfriend had to delay her trip to meet me due to rescheduling of her exam dates. I still kept hope that all this will end soon and things will start going back to normal. I was still unable to recover my voice, so I started looking for some place which can provide voice therapy. 

Eventually after a few days my girlfriend broke up with me. I don't want to mention the reason here for the breakup but it broke me more than my health condition. I kind of lost all motivation to get better. But I kept going for the effort my family had put in for my recovery. I joined voice therapy and gave it my all. The therapist had told me that my voice recovery can take upto 3 to 6 months or maybe even more. But I gave it my best shot and got my voice back in 2 months of joining the therapy. 

Currently I have resumed my work and have completed 5th semester of my studies as well. My brother got engaged last month and we had a huge party for the same where all my relatives came. I was able to dance with all of them all of them were really happy and it was almost like the medical stuff didn't really happen. I had a huge smile thoughout the engagement party but it wasn't entirely because my brother was getting engaged. I am still sad about what happened between me and my girlfriend. She broke up with me on my birthday while I was in a neck brace and was unable to speak. She didn't even try to call me and broke up over text. I didn't get any closure and now I am just lost. Under the smile of my brother's engagement I was hiding my own pain. I was hands-on with everything at the party to avoid my tears and keep myself busy.

76,I don't know what to do anymore,"I don't know what this post is: am I asking for advice? support? or just wanting to tell someone...


I guess for a little bit of History: I grew up in a cult that taught me from a very young age that I was a reclonation and a descendant of aliens that was mistaken as gods... me and my siblings were separated from society, and I had no idea people others could be sad without a reason so I always hided it, cuz I was so scared of... feeling incorrectly... 

I think I've had depression since I was 8 years old or younger. Although I was basically born in a mask; I started turely sculpting it as I went emotionally numb between the ages of 8 and 12. Until I was 16 and nearly attempted suicide and decided I was going to feel again so it wouldn't happen... took 3 years of ripping off that barbed wire ""happy"" mask to realize that I'm a trans man, and a small part of my problem was to hide gender dysphoria.

Now I'm 23, couple of weeks ago you had to put down my dog, I just lost my job,  I'm about to move (still living with my parents) and I'm terrified of change...
kAnd now I'm on antidepressants for the first time in my life and I don't think they're working... I started burning myself with lighters, and I'm not sure what counts as suicidal but I don't care if I die... before I started the medication, I simply had intrusive imagery different ways I could stop at all...

Improvement has made me actually not want to isolate anymore, but I don't have a choice. I lost my only close friendships several years ago in a very traumatic way. I really make the effort to maintain acquaintanceship but every. single. one. stops talking to me despite my efforts to reach out and be friendly.

80,"Depression, dysfunctionality of everyday life and shame","I have been diagnosed with depression for over a year and am currently on heavy medication. Despite my struggles, I have been in a recovery stage for the last 2-3 months. My doctor has said it would take another 4-6 months to completely get to normal. I am just trying to hang in there and slowly fix things up. 

I accepted every disaster depression has caused me with my head held high until I realized how it had screwed my finance. I knew my emergency fund was gone last year. I have massive credit card debt. And all this time, I tried reassuring myself by thinking it was just inflation. This week, I finally sat with all my bills, realizing it was not just inflation. But also my depression. My depression did not let me stop when I knew I had overspent, or it made it difficult to check my bills or control my spending. 

My father does not save, and my mother is constantly anxious about my father not saving single money for the family. Because of all the tension-anxiety-frustration, I have seen growing up in my family caused by money, I have always felt this guilt of not saving enough. But I also like spending on things I value, eating good food and giving away stuff to people I love. So I did this all but constantly felt I was not 'saving' enough. And I guess when my depression peaked and my defense was severed entirely, I think I started ignoring my spending habits because I was running away from all the mental pressure it brings.

But now, when I finally face it, I feel so ashamed. I can not express this to anyone! How can I tell my family or partner that I eat up all my emergency funds and put myself in debt because I could not handle my spending habit? I have a good-earning job and no financial liabilities; I have bought nothing like jewelry, cars, or electronics! How do I tell anyone that I just ordered too much food, smoked too many cigarettes, visited high-end restaurants, and made too many impulsive purchases on personal care items? And when I finally faced it, I panicked and took a high-interest loan to pay my credit card bill, knowing that if I had asked my family or friends, I don't have to burden myself with absurd interest. But I can not! And now, I also have to face that the loan was a bad decision; instead, I could have done so many things to pay the bill!

Yeah, this is something I just wanted to share without any judgment. I know I have made mistakes, some of which I did not have control over. But now I have assessed everything and hope to be in a better financial position by next year.",depression_help

I keep wanting to rest but I can’t turn off my work switch. When I’m at home I just want to cook and I make delicious food I take a few bites of then ignore it and continue to snack on junk food. My love is frustrated with me (rightfully so) because I say I want to spend time with him and then I go to cook for hours. (He’s 8hrs ahead of me).

I want to spend time with him but I also want to be alone. I’ve completely fudged up my schedule with putting work ahead of everything else, and neglected my room’s and my own hygiene.

I’m trying so hard to prioritize my mental health for a sense of normalcy and the sake of our relationship but it’s so hard. I’ve lost so many this year (human and animal family both) and I don’t know how to cope other than spend and cut. I know I’m nearing the end of my sobriety at this point with cutting and I don’t know what else to do.

My attempts at therapy since my first therapists have all been failures, I’m scared to get disability benefits because I’d like there to be as little issues as possible moving in with my fiancé abroad, and I thought I had my gender identity figured out but I guess it’s felt off again.

85,Family issues getting to me,"Years ago my sister got married to a man who turned out to be physically and emotionally abusive. He would cheat on her and if she confronted him he would beat her extremely.
My sister worked but he took all her money and on top of that she had to cook for him and do everything around the house perfectly. He constantly threw abusing and insulting words at her in front of everyone.
Because we didn’t live in a gender equal country he got away with lots until one day she ran away with her kids. Now many years later her son is being manipulated by dad and is so verbally disrespectful to her. He is still young but I’m afraid he could be physically violent when he is older. He always idealizes his father and says he wants to be tough and aggressive. His attitude toward all of us is like we have to serve him but that’s it. He wouldn’t listen to us or be respectful.

However, I still feel the symptons of depression and there are times my anxiety comes back. The depression feels like it has

not improved, perhaps worsen. Wouldn't say I am suicidal or sad, but more disinterested and unmotivated. It feels difficult to do simple tasks, and around this time keeping my schedule feels a tad harder. It feels like my body physical gets tired easily, I had to take some vitamin D at some point, I would probably need to ask for more. However, I kinda isolated myself from the outside world a lot, that doing basic reading or research or anything evokes anxiety or it feels like my body is against that idea. I try to read, but it feels like my eyes are trying to zoom past and race through everything, I can't seem to function basic things. Not sure what to say next, throughout this paragraph, I kinda jumped around. At the start I had a rough idea, what I wanted to say, but now I feel like I am rushing and going more on a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

This was meant for a discord server, but posting this has made me want to post this on reddit. I am not sure if I want help, I am more just trying to understand myself. It feels like my body and mind are not tuned, at times. Not sure, maybe speaking and having people ask me questions can answer my own questions. I have thought about making a small youtube diary thing because it sounds mildly interesting.",depression_help
88,I feel even more lost now,"I’ve always been depressed and anxious. Grew up in a bad home with abusive parents so I got out as soon as I could. I skipped a year of high school. Got my associates at 20. And landed my first corporate position a month before my 21st birthday. It sounds like a great life improvement story but I’ve been struggling for so long I didn’t know what else to do. 


Well today was my 22nd birthday I’m in a relationship that I’m failing, my body isn’t functioning properly, and I was let go from my steady job because of budgeting concerns(the day before my birthday).


I feel like I’m 16 again having absolutely no control over anything. I want to bang my head against the wal and shove my nails into the palms of my hands just to have control over that at least. 


I feel so alone and so tired. I’m so tired of trying to be better, to grow, and be someone I’m not. I feel like I can’t even talk to anyone about this especially not my boyfriend because he’s already so tired of my depression and having to help me through tough times. 


I’m gonna get a new job and be settled there but everything just feels so hard right now. Everything comes together then falls apart again. This cycle continues over and over does life ever change and get better after this. Does the really bad stuff ever stop. How can I handle this without spiraling.",depression_help
89,Relationship making depression worse?,"Now let me start by saying that I in no way think my relationship is solely causing my depression. I've been dealing with depression since I was a teenager. 
I've only been with my partner for 2 years, living together a year. 

My problem at the moment is my depression is really really bad. I'm frequently suicidal and I don't know if my partner is putting me down to the point of hurting me or if I'm just so depressed that I'm sensitive to every little thing and I'm hearing insults where there aren't any. 

I'm struggling with knowing if I should bring this up or not because I obviously don't like feeling this way but I also don't want to over react and make my partner feel like she can't talk around me for fear of hurting me. 

She has said one really big hurtful thing in the past which we discussed and she apologised and I've had previous relationship trauma of a ex who spent most of our relationship mocking me for every thing I said or did then would disappear if I tried to have a conversation about it. I'm not sure if these things together are making me read too much into things my partner says or if I should be wary of this relationship. 

Any advice, suggestions or personal experiences with something similar you want to share would be appreciated. Thanks.",depression_help

94,Weaning off generic Lexapro," Hey yall, im new to the community here so im not sure if this is the right place.

Anyways, I was on a generic Lexapro the last 2+ years and I have been doing incredibly great this year so I decided it was time to wean off. The drug certainly did its job when I needed it, but I never really liked it.

I weaned off it over 8 weeks, and have been totally done for about 3.5 weeks now. It started out good, really good, but then last week out of nowhere I started going down, and this week has been one of the worst ever.

My question is, am I feeling side effects of the lexapro still leaving my body? Did I wean off of it wrong? Or am I just absent of the drug now and this is how my brain normally functions?

I feel like I am somewhat clear headed now, and that I have been ""high"" for the past two years. I don't really want to go back on it, but I suppose I am open to other things. However I don't have insurance or therapist at the moment so that makes it somewhat difficult.

101,"I feel tremendous guilt. Day in, day out.","As heartbreaking as it is for me to write this, I must. The trauma and emotional abuse that my family has put me through, I am starting to realise that this is unintentionally isolating me from my current relationships. Having the sudden realisation of how none of what I have been experiencing is normal or acceptable in any way and sharing that with those few friends I have, I can tell they are finding it so hard to understand and relate to me. 

For context, I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands. We have never met IRL but his friendship offers such a safe space for me even though it is virtual, all of our interactions are online and at the moment mostly via text due to how ran down I feel and also I am at my family home where the people who have abused me live. On top of that, I have an ex boyfriend who I speak to regularly but that is long distance. Same country but still not ideal. A few friends but people I have only met fairly recently and the only ones who seem to actually respond are men, not women which just makes me question their motives to begin with. I am so incredibly lonely and that alone is a killer. Baring in mind with everything else going on, I don't know how to manage. I don't know where or who to go to. I wish with all my heart I had a friend who I can really talk to and have a safe, healthy, uplifting place in the world together. Our little corner, you could say.

I am a 24 year old woman who is at risk mentally and unfortunately have very little funds in the bank currently, although I am on a benefit due to my condition and mental ill health. Ideally, my plan is to get a job, perhaps a café job and get myself out of this situation but that feels so far away right now because I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed and to do the every day expected things. I feel like I'm slowly falling apart. 

Thankfully I manage to get paid on the 9th which then I can possibly have some online therapy via video chat. I am relieved that finally my family are now acknowledging how horrific this have become and respect my bedroom is my private space now and will leave me to my own devices. I feel so alone and I just wish I had someone to talk to who understands or can at least guide me in the right direction. I cannot believe this is what my life has come to.

I’m weathering a really difficult breakup, and aware now more than ever the degree to which I’ve handed others the responsibility for my feeling happy and emotionally safe. My depression is not just situational - the what’s-the-point feelings have existed since childhood and only gotten bigger as I’ve gotten older, with fun new wanting-to-die feelings getting added in the mix.

It is very difficult to see self-love as the ultimate goal rather than a consolation prize, but it finally clicked for me today that looking outside myself for love that I don’t feel worthy of is 100% always going to make me suffer. And wow, has it ever. 

I listened to 10/10 by Rex Orange County and the lyrics resonated really deeply. Can anyone recommend songs in a similar vein, ie not about finding love, losing love, getting over anyone, but just about overcoming hard times as an individual human?

112,How to keep in touch with depressed friend who’s isolating themself?,"My friend’s been struggling with depression that has gotten really bad. He was a really smart school kid. We became friends in high school. he’s basically been having an existential crisis. We die then we disappear into nothingness sort of thing. He had a rant about it and I really wanted to hold his hand but I can’t do something like that.

It’s not just that of course. Feeling really lonely, a series of unsuccessful dating attempts, even going to a foreign country to visit some guy he didn’t even really like. He was just hoping for a connection. It was a disaster. It seems veering on self-distructive behaviour to me. He’s been failing at university. (I’ve graduated) He’s had panic attacks. Last time we met he told me his male friends changed towards him after he came out and he’s never doing it again. I got him tickets to go to a really nice event together to try cheer him up but he suddenly said he’d changed his mind and didn’t want to go anymore. After a few days he texted he’d dropped out of university and didn’t want to talk. He was very snippy when I tried to comfort him on his decision.

I’m worried he’s entering that isolation phase of depression. How do I prevent this? My mum said that when she was having a really hard time, even two panic attacks and suicidal thoughts (friggivgn f the people that put her through that) that a message of support from someone really helped. She also sent messages of affection to my sister when she herself was becoming isolated. But I would feel awkward texting, “sup dude, I’m thinking of you” everyday like my mum would message my sister. I dunno. Any tips? Do I do that even if it’s cringe? I don‘t want to give up on him because it’ll just make things worse. I’m also afraid of pushing in case it annoys him or it’s inappropriate. What’s the depression and what’s just him? He’s moved back with his parents so we’re close together again.

114,I feel like a failure and hopeless,"1 year ago I had a huge panic attack at work, making me leave and cry without stopping. I had to go to a psychiatrist and get meds. At the time I was in a severe depression. In this last year I was with 2 women, the 2 of them leave me for stupid reasons (I believe they couldn't handle me and my condition). They were very rude and for a long time I thought I was responsible when I'm such a nice guy. Also I had to take a license of absent from work and leave because it was making me really bad mentally since the co-managers and some supervisors were so rude with me because I was best than they favorite on the same position. Working like that and even being passively harassed I decided to leave. At the same time I ""study"" I'm on my 8th year and I don't even know If what I'm doing is what I want. I have a bachelor on Interdisciplinary Sciences (General Sciences). and now was doing another one on Biomedical Engineering. At the same time I'm an artist and I'm customizing shoes with a lot of details and also learned how to design, embroider and using and repairing a embroidery machine by my own in the last two months. I also met a girl via online dating who has treated me like no one ever done, she recognize everything I have as a good guy. We have a distance even that we are on the same country but a Hurricane affected her more than me and she's going for so much pressure that asked me for space because her anxiety makes her unable to talk. She still doesn't have power after 2 weeks. We decided to not cut what we had, well we knew that this can work on a great condition on future. I told her I would wait because she's worth it and I wont keep meeting immature girls if I know that waiting can give me an amazing one, she decided the same for the same reason.

119,Girlfriend of two years cheated,"About a month and a half ago my girlfriend (19f) and I (19m) split after 2 years. I just found out today that she was unfaithful/broke up with me to have sex with other men.

We go to 2 universities in the same area and we grew up together in the same area too. I go to a much more prestigious university than she does but I didn’t let that come between us. She felt like that was a major source of insecurity in the relationship even when I assured her it didn’t make me or my family think any differently of her.

She had a pretty major fight with my sister about something stupid about 6 months ago and it caused a lot of tension between our families and it really strained the relationship. It came to a point where we had such a bad fight that she says she was considering breaking up with me over it, and I assured her that we would work it through and get past it. A couple weeks later she told me she was over it and I thought we were moving forward. I think it’s also important that my mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer and I had just lost my grandfather within the same month as the fight, so I was already going through a lot. 

She goes away for the summer to work at an overnight scout camp where most of the other workers are men. It didn’t bug me, especially since she let me hang around platonic girl friends I have here at university, although she has expressed a fair amount of jealousy and insecurity over it. 

I was taking a summer course so we didn’t talk or see each other nearly as much as normal. I catch wind of her ignoring my texts but seeing that she’s online and texting other guys throughout the day, I brought it up to her when we called at night but she said there was nothing to beworried  about.

During the last week of my course and her work she told me about how her guy friends at camp were calling me a twink and a f*g and how they could beat me up and would be a better fit for her than me. I told her I was uncomfortable from this but she told me that I just have to come out and meet them. I do and I briefly met them, but the whole day I visited her she ignored me just to hang out with them. She was originally supposed to take me back to our hometown that night but she then informs me while I’m there that I have to find my own rice back bedside she wants to stay another night there. I was annoyed and tried to talk to her about it but she wouldn’t let me. This was two days before we took a trip together with another group. 

She ignores me for the whole trip and only hangs out with other friends on the trip and cuts me off and only talks to me in the middle to tell me she wants to break up. She said it was because of the fight and she feels that I didn’t make her feel heard despite the fact that she had told me months earlier that she was over it. She also told me that the university prestige thing was something she couldn’t get over but also that we should break up because she’s bisexual I guess?

I was fucking pissed at her and blocked her on everything after the trip. It’s been about a month and a half and I just found out from her cousin who I am still close with that she was staying over at her camp coworkers houses since the breakup and that she lied to her day about them all being gay (and me too I guess because she told me that too).

I don’t have any evidence that she hactually was having sex with them during the relationship but it was beyond clear that she was after we broke up. Either way she heavily violated the boundaries of our relationship and even though I’ve been with other girls since the breakup hearing that she betrayed me to that level has hurt me to an extent I have never known before. 

I am devastated even having thought I had already moved in and I don’t know what to do. She kept saying that I was such a. Terbike boyfriend to all of our friends and she kept saying that I engineered the breakup but kept changing the story every time she told it. It’s clear to me that she did this so she could have sex with them free of a guilty consciousness and it is to my friends and her cousin as well.

I am distraught. I loved her so much and gave her so much time and love and energy over ThTs past two years and I know that I don’t deserve this. I really need help and I don’t know where else to turn. I’m not sure I can ever trust another partner again",depression_help

I’ve done everything in the list of how to help depression but i still spiral every year. it’s exhausting to continuously have to fight against this and sometimes i feel like i don’t have any fight left in me. the other thing i can never shake off is wanting to feel really loved. i like myself for the most part and i’ve been okay being on my own for the past few years. but i work remotely so i rarely meet other people. dating apps never work out and i just feel like maybe i won’t find anyone to connect deeply with again. i try not to care about it but i’m such an emotional person that really values relationships. i get really depressed bc i often feel like i always care for the other person (friends and romantically) more than they do about me. i constantly wish that i would
stop caring about people.
i know being empathetic and compassionate are great traits but i wish i could just not care about anyone and live selfishly. honestly feel like just never interacting with another person ever again bc social relationships and interactions have strong effects on me. i’m just really tired and feel like i don’t know where else to go.",depression_help

124,Depressed about being short in my mid 20s.,"I passed 25 and still 5""6, and I feel inferior and out of place around other men who are 5""8 to 5""10 or over.

Feel like an imposter, mimicking or perfecting all of the mannerisms expected of most men.

Never experienced insecurity until other people began to judge my height before recognising my character.

I just need advice on boosting confidence.",depression_help
